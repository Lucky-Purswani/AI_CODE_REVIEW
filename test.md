The line `int a = a--b;` is **syntactically incorrect** in C, C++, Java, and similar languages. It will result in a **compiler error**.

Here's why:

1.  **`int a;`**: This declares an integer variable `a`. At this point, `a` has an indeterminate value (unless it's a global/static variable, in which case it's zero-initialized).

2.  **`a--b;`**: This is the problematic part.
    *   The compiler tries to interpret `a--`. This is recognized as the **postfix decrement operator** applied to `a`. So, `a` would be decremented, and the value of `a` *before* decrementing would be used in the expression.
    *   However, after `a--`, the `b` is left floating without any operator connecting it to the `a--` expression.
    *   The parser applies a "maximal munch" or "greedy" rule, meaning it tries to form the longest possible valid token. So it sees `a`, then `--`, and combines them into `a--`. It does *not* see `a`, then `-`, then `-`, then `b` to interpret it as `a - (-b)` or `a - b`.

**Common Interpretations (and how to write them correctly):**

People often write `a--b` when they intend one of these:

1.  **Simple Subtraction:** `a = a - b;`
    *   Subtracts the value of `b` from `a` and assigns the result back to `a`.

2.  **Decrement `a` THEN Subtract `b`:** `a = (a--) - b;` or simply `a = a-- - b;`
    *   First, `a`'s original value is used in the subtraction. Then, `a` is decremented.
    *   Example: If `a = 10` and `b = 3`:
        *   `a`'s value (10) is used in `10 - 3`.
        *   `a` becomes `9`.
        *   `a` is assigned `7`. (So, `a` becomes `7`, and `a` was also decremented to `9` at some point during the expression evaluation - this is where sequence points and undefined behavior can get tricky if `a` is used again in the *same* expression after the decrement). For clarity, `a = (original_a_value) - b; a = original_a_value - 1;`
    *   It's safer and clearer to do it in two steps if you need to be sure:
        ```c++
        int temp_a = a;
        a--; // decrement a
        a = temp_a - b; // then perform subtraction using original a
        ```

3.  **Subtract `b` (which is decremented postfix) from `a`:** `a = a - (b--);`
    *   `b`'s original value is used in the subtraction. Then, `b` is decremented.
    *   Example: If `a = 10`, `b = 3`:
        *   `a` is assigned `10 - 3`.
        *   `b` becomes `2`.
        *   `a` becomes `7`.

4.  **Subtract `b` (which is decremented prefix) from `a`:** `a = a - (--b);`
    *   `b` is decremented *first*. Then, the new value of `b` is used in the subtraction.
    *   Example: If `a = 10`, `b = 3`:
        *   `b` becomes `2`.
        *   `a` is assigned `10 - 2`.
        *   `a` becomes `8`.

**In summary, `int a = a--b;` is a syntax error because `a--` is a complete expression, and `b` immediately following it has no operator to connect it.** You must explicitly use an operator like `-` (subtraction) if that's your intent.
